(00000) Implement a column-cutting minigame, column inlet-placement minigame

(00000) Add an integration feature for peak area as well as peak width that can be marked on the linechart

(0000) Add a label for when you hit inject (inserts an arrow onto the linechart coordinate system marking this)

(000) Implement a Column switching feature (and column alert for buying a new one when you destroy it)

(00) Implement a "Sensor" that allows you to watch up to 5 peaks elution time values.

(0) Use Oracle's guide for implementing javaFX app on the web
 - Deploying JavaFX application 7
 - Make a git branch main and git branch web (the web branch will contain a Jar file, Web Page, Document for the Web)

(0) Implement a "Watch Recent" zoom profile that autozooms to the past 45 seconds and projects into the next 15 seconds.

(0) Implement A filter function for the Inject Window that binds InjectionUIRecord visibility to filtered search terms

(0) Implement simulation speed feature (allow to toggle between 1.0X - 5.0X)

(10) Implement density data for each analyte -- OR NOT

(4) Implement a label next to the userInputChemicals that shows the on-column weight of each userInputChemical

(1) Implement the Injection Presets (use an accordion in the left pane of the Inject Button UI)

(3) Add locking and lazy thread initilization to increase performance of Inject Button

(5) Implement peak response feature. This should be done by turning the molar response factors into a relative scale
    of arbitrary peak areas that are fairly human reading. For example, consider a typical mass that could be injected
    on-column such as 133 ng of methyl octanoate. Methyl octanoate has a molar response factor of ~1. 133 ng of methyl
    octanoate is equal to 8.4e-10 moles of methyl octanoate. It is not very readable to say that the area of methyl
    octanoate is 8.4e-10 arbitrary units of area. It is better to multiply the number of moles by a constant to yield,
    lets say, 500 arbitary units of area. A proportionalityConstant = 5.952e11 * 8.4e-10 moles = 500 peak area units.

(6) Implement the ExceedingMaxTemp feature
    DONE: Max temp of column can be exceeded and will result in column breaking for all columns in temperature dependent
    rate and manner
    (6)(A) Implement a reduction of the LSER constants based on temp
    (6)(B) Implement a random peak generator for when the column is being destroyed

(7) columnAdjustedOverloadMass should be implemented.
    (7)(A) Use the overloadMass_1 as described in README.

(8) A fast forward/FINISH RUN button must be implemented. If the usefulness of this program is that it allows
    the retentionTimes, relative peak areas, to be predicted roughly correctly... it would be nice to go faster and just
    get to the point.

(9) Refactor Column code so that DB_1701 and HP_Innowax columns are based on the film thickness 1.0 um versions
    DONE: implemented

(10) Implement helper tips that show up on the screen when triggered:
    (10)(A) Example: if nearly ALL the peaks are exhibiting peak fronting, suggest using a column with a higher
            sample loading capacity (thicker film) or suggest increasing split ratio or suggest lowering concentration
            on sample.
    (10)(B) Example: if user raises the oven temperature above the column max temperature, the baseline should start to
            get really bad and random peaks should start to generate (broken off pieces of stationary phase). After 10
            seconds of this or so, alert a helper tip that suggests "You may have noticed your baseline is behaving
            really strangely... why do you think this is happening?" then another helper tip 10 seconds later that says
            "Oven Temp has exceeded max column temp! It's been destroyed! Now you will have to beg Dr. Travis for
            hundreds of dollars to replace the column!"

(11) Implement a "Learning Tip:" feature that is served to the user at application startup.
    (11)(A) "Learning Tip: LET'S BREAK STUFF! The DB225 column has a max temp of 240 degrees. Install it, then set the
            oven to 350 and see what happens!"
    (11)(B) "Learning Tip: Ask ChatGPT "Could you describe the intermolecular forces that determine how strongly a
            molecule interacts with the stationary phase in a GC capillary column?"
    (11)(C) ... TOPICS: retention time, peak area, LSER constants, peak shape, why columns have a max temperature, etc.

(12) Make sure that if you switch to a new column, get the appropriate values of CURRENT_COLUMN_DAMAGE and REMAINING
     from the columnToDamage HashMap.
    (12)(A) The only way to update the columnToDamage HashMap is the "Buy new Column" button that resets these values to
            0 for the newly purchased column. Make sure that the UI hastles you and references begging Travis for money.
